## 👩‍💻 About Me  
🚀 Frontend Developer passionate about building scalable, performant, and accessible web applications.  
Since 2023, I’ve been working mostly with **Angular (v17–19)** creating reusable components, implementing state management, and contributing to tech stack migrations.  

I enjoy combining creativity with strong engineering practices such as **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and agile workflows.  

You can take a look at PASTAPP, a pasta recipe project I created with a modular structure, reusable user interface components, and reactive state management with RxJS.
